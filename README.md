# Learn-Github
GitHub tutorial follow along
I don't know why i can't open an empty github repo
but anyways, this is just readme version 1
only because i have to use this repo from vs code remote repo
let's add another line in the readme to get multiple files into the staging environment
same line same position for conflict
another line added for the main branch AND this is on github

same line different position for conflict
different line diffrent position on github
