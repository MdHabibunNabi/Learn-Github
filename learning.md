this is for what is learned through this follow along tutorial from w3schools

#       Lesson 1:
                Try committing the changes for a single file in a single commit

#       Lesson 2:
                Branches are messed up. I haven't found any way to visualize branches as a tree. So, for now, just use branches by this convention: use parent underscore child branch.
                <span style="color:lightgreen; font-weight:bold;">
                        main>>main_login
                        main>>main_login>>main_login_password
                        main>>main_theme
                        main>>main_theme>>main_theme_dark

                so most likely nested branches work, but it can't be visualized which branch is it nested under, so use that naming convention to be clear.

#       Lesson 3:
                Actually the versioning convention looks better and more readable if an unerscore added between the years, months, and days too. So, new versioning convention:
                        YYYY_MM_DD_HH_MM_AA
